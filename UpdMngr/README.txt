The aim is to implement an autonomous DSS as defined in [2] with upstream server being
one of Microsoft's ones.
We consider implementing :
- invoking the Server Sync Web Service hosted on Microsoft update.
- invoking the DSS Authorization Web Service hosted on Microsoft update.

As of writing, the Microsoft update service is located at http://update.microsoft.com
